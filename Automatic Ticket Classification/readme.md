# Automatic Ticket classification


## Problem Statement

For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 
These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.

## Business goal
A model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services shall be built. The model will be able to segregate the tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue in the tickets.

## Major Steps

- Data loading
- Text preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction
- Topic modelling 
- Model building using supervised learning
- Model training and evaluation
- Model inference

# Disease and Treatment Identification

## Problem Statemnt
BeHealthy is a compay in the healthcare sector that aims to connect the medical communities with millions of patients across the country. ‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions.
‘BeHealthy’ is  generating huge data day by day, which is unstructured and may contain many medical terms that couldn't be recognized by a person from non-medical background. So BeHealthy has provided this data where a lot of diseases and their related treatments are mentioned implicitly in the text.
Our goal it to train a model beased on NLP to produce an output as key value pairs where keys specify diseases, and values their treatments.

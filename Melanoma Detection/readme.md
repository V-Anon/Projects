# Melanoma-Detection
> To build a mutliclass classification model using custom CNN to accurately detect Melanoma.

## Summary
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
Model was trained using neural networking, and overfitting and class imbalance were handled through Data Augmentation, Addition of Dropout Layers and Normalization. Final model has a train accuracy of 0.93 and validation accuracy of 0.82.
